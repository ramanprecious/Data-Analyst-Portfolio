Repository containing portfolio of data analytics projects completed by me presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
It also contains work completed as part of my Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree.

The udacity's online data analyst programme has helped me learn to clean and organize data, identify patterns and insights, make meaningful conclusions, and clearly convey crucial results, preparing me for a job as a data analyst. As I construct a portfolio of projects, I am honing my skills in Python and its data analysis tools (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib).

## Project one - [No show appointment](https://github.com/ramanprecious/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

This project investigates medical appointments in Brazil in 2016 to determine why a person will make an appointment with a doctor and be absent on the visitation day. This has been the case in brazilian health sector over the years and even though a mitigating option, reminder by sms, was employed, there seem to be no visible change in the responses of people to scheduled visits. 
The goal of this project is to understand:

1. Do patients under the Brazilian welfare scholarship program show up more than other patients?

2. Does receiving reminder messages influence honoring appointment schedules?

3. What age group is most registered for health check up? Which show up more?

4. Does the number of days between appointment and scheduled date have an effect on the showing up of a patient?

5. Which gender predominantly showup for appointment?

Project Methodology:
- Import necessary libraries
- Load necessary dataset
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis

## Project two - [We Rate Dogs](https://github.com/ramanprecious/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/WeRateDogs/wrangle_act.ipynb)

This project focuses on the use of data analytics skills, with major concentration on the pandas, to analyse datasets obtained from twitter's space. The real purpose of the project is to apply wrangle and visualize a real-world data to expose hidden insights and answer questions. 

**WeRateDogs** is an international recognised account on the twitter platform, with over four million active followers, which engages its audience to rate posted dog images. The dataset explored in this project was derived from three seperate pieces of data gathered from WeRateDogs using three data gathering techniques.

Project Methodology:
- Gathering data
- Accessing data
- Cleaning data
- Exploratory Data Visualization

The gathering methods are **downloading locally**, **downloading programmatically** and **use of Twitter API**.
