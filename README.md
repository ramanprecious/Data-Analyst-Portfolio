Repository containing portfolio of data analytics projects completed by me presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
It also contains work completed as part of my Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree.

The udacity's online data analyst programme has helped me learn to clean and organize data, identify patterns and insights, make meaningful conclusions, and clearly convey crucial results, preparing me for a job as a data analyst. As I construct a portfolio of projects, I am honing my skills in Python and its data analysis tools (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib).

## Project one - [No show appointment](https://github.com/ramanprecious/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

This project investigates medical appointments in Brazil in 2016 to determine why a person will make an appointment with a doctor and be absent on the visitation day. This has been the case in brazilian health sector over the years and even though a mitigating option, reminder by sms, was employed, there seem to be no visible change in the responses of people to scheduled visits. 
The goal of this project is to understand:

1. Do patients under the Brazilian welfare scholarship program show up more than other patients?

2. Does receiving reminder messages influence honoring appointment schedules?

3. What age group is most registered for health check up? Which show up more?

4. Does the number of days between appointment and scheduled date have an effect on the showing up of a patient?

5. Which gender predominantly showup for appointment?

Project Methodology:
- Import necessary libraries
- Load necessary dataset
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis
